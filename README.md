# Logo Generator

  ![License Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-green.svg)

  ## Description

  This project was created to help create basic logos using three shapes, three or less letters, and colors to make a logo easily without hassle. One simply starts the code in terminal using `node` and then the copied path of the `index.js` file, answers the questions (using basic colors or hexidecimal numbers for colors), and then a logo will be generated in the `/examples` folder.
